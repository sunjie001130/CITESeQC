# CITESeQC

CITESeQC is an R package that enables comprehensive, quantitative, and reproducible quality control for CITE-seq data.

1. For comprehensive quality control, CITESeQC assesses the quality of not only the gene expression layer and the surface protein layer but also their interactions.
2. For quantitative QC, CITESeQC quantifies the specificity of marker genes or protein markers across clusters and their correlational relationships using Spearmanâ€™s correlation and visualizes the relationship distribution across cell clusters in the histogram.
3. For reproducible QC, CITESeQC will guide users through a simple linear process that results in a full markdown report with supporting figures and explanations with minimal intervention from the user.
